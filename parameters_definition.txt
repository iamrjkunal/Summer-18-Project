trace_length:-  how many for loops or if else come before the line where bug is present
global_nesting_depth :-  real depth of if-else / for / while when used inside for / if-else / while   
call_depth :- recursive depth of function at which bug is present
no_of_local_variable :- 
taint_count :- no of times the given condition inside if-else or any is updated if many updation is present then taint count is max of them
